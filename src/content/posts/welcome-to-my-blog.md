# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my technical blog! I'm excited to share my journey and insights in software engineering with you.

## What This Blog Is About

This blog focuses on practical software engineering topics that I encounter in my daily work as a backend engineer. You can expect in-depth articles about:

- **Backend Development**: Spring Boot, Kotlin, Java, and modern backend architectures
- **System Design**: Scalable systems, microservices, and distributed systems
- **Database Engineering**: SQL optimization, NoSQL databases, and data modeling
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, containerization, Kubernetes, and infrastructure as code
- **Performance Engineering**: Profiling, optimization techniques, and best practices

## Why I'm Writing

I believe that writing is one of the best ways to solidify understanding. By documenting what I learn and sharing my experiences, I hope to:

1. Help others facing similar challenges
2. Create a knowledge base for myself to reference later
3. Engage with the broader engineering community
4. Continuously improve my communication skills

## What Makes This Blog Different

All content here is based on **real-world experience**. I won't just regurgitate documentation or write theoretical pieces. Every article will include:

- Practical examples and code snippets
- Performance considerations
- Trade-offs and decision-making rationale
- Lessons learned from production systems

## Topics I'm Planning to Cover

Here are some topics I'm excited to write about:

### Spring Boot Deep Dives
- Building scalable REST APIs with Spring Boot
- Advanced Spring Data JPA techniques
- Performance optimization in Spring applications
- Testing strategies for Spring Boot applications

### Kotlin in Production
- Why Kotlin over Java for new projects
- Coroutines and asynchronous programming
- Functional programming patterns in Kotlin
- Migrating from Java to Kotlin

### System Architecture
- Designing for high availability
- Event-driven architectures
- CQRS and Event Sourcing
- Microservices best practices

### Database Engineering
- Query optimization techniques
- Indexing strategies
- Database scaling patterns
- PostgreSQL advanced features

## How Often I'll Post

I'm aiming to publish **at least one in-depth article per week**. Quality over quantity is my motto, so some weeks might have longer, more comprehensive posts.
